    <h4>How to Leave the Planet</h4>
    <p>
        1. Phone NASA (or your local space agency). Their Phone Number is  &nbsp;<a href="tel:(731) 483-3111">(731) 483-3111</a>. Explain that it's very important that you get away as soon as possible.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        2. If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you may have in the White House -- <a href="tel:(202) 456-1414">(202) 456-1414</a>-- to have a word on your behalf with the guys at NASA.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. If you don't have any friends at the White House, phone the Kremlin (ask the overseas operator for 010705-295-9051). They don't have any friends their either (at least none to speak of), but they do seem to have a little influence, so you may as well try.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. If that slo fails, phone the Pope for guidance. his telephone number is 011-394-6982, and I gather his switchboard is infallible.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. If all these attemps fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and explain that it's vitally important you get away before your phone bills arrive.
